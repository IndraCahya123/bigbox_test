To run the program, i use a server to run the index.html file(in my case i use live server in visual studio code extension).

And then open the console after the index.html page is running.Â 

To run the first program, call the modifiedObjects() function.

And to run the second program, call the diceGame(players, dices) -> this function need two arguments, the first is the sum of players and the second is the sum of dices, and all the arguments type are integer.
